    if it had serialized it. This could likely indicate an issue
    with the data structure.

    For example, if the data structure has an ``id`` property that
    is an ``int``, it would prefer to be formatted as a primitive of
    ``int``. If instead it got a ``str`` as the primitive type, it
    may indicate that the data strcture itself should have the ``id``
    as a ``str``, even if it would convert correctly, because ``int``
    may not be sufficient to interpret all possible values.
